# Portfolio

This week, instead of a learning diary article, I have made a portfolio on a sensor - the ALOS project launched by Japan.

Using Quarto and Xaringan, we aim to create an online portfolio for my works!

## The presentation

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='40%'}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  url = "https://sokimura39.github.io/RS_sensor_presentation/",
  ratio = "16:9")
```
