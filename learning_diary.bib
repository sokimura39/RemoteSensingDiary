  abstract = {Rapid increase in population and growing concentration of capital in urban areas has escalated both the severity and longer-term impact of natural disasters. As a result, Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and reduction have been gaining increasing importance for urban areas. Remote sensing plays a key role in providing information for urban DRM analysis due to its agile data acquisition, synoptic perspective, growing range of data types, and instrument sophistication, as well as low cost. As a consequence numerous methods have been developed to extract information for various phases of DRM analysis. However, given the diverse information needs, only few of the parameters of interest are extracted directly, while the majority have to be elicited indirectly using proxies. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the proxies developed for two risk elements typically associated with pre-disaster situations (vulnerability and resilience), and two post-disaster elements (damage and recovery), while focusing on urban DRM. The proxies were reviewed in the context of four main environments and their corresponding sub-categories: built-up (buildings, transport, and others), economic (macro, regional and urban economics, and logistics), social (services and infrastructures, and socio-economic status), and natural. All environments and the corresponding proxies are discussed and analyzed in terms of their reliability and sufficiency in comprehensively addressing the selected DRM assessments. We highlight strength and identify gaps and limitations in current proxies, including inconsistencies in terminology for indirect measurements. We present a systematic overview for each group of the reviewed proxies that could simplify cross-fertilization across different DRM domains and may assist the further development of methods. While systemizing examples from the wider remote sensing domain and insights from social and economic sciences, we suggest a direction for developing new proxies, also potentially suitable for capturing functional recovery.},

  abstract = {Since 2000, there have been a number of spaceborne satellites that have changed the way we assess and predict natural hazards. These satellites are able to quantify physical geographic phenomena associated with the movements of the earth's surface (earthquakes, mass movements), water (floods, tsunamis, storms), and fire (wildfires). Most of these satellites contain active or passive sensors that can be utilized by the scientific community for the remote sensing of natural hazards over a number of spatial and temporal scales. The most useful satellite imagery for the assessment of earthquake damage comes from high-resolution (0.6 m to 1 m pixel size) passive sensors and moderate resolution active sensors that can quantify the vertical and horizontal movement of the earth's surface. High-resolution passive sensors have been used successfully to assess flood damage while predictive maps of flood vulnerability areas are possible based on physical variables collected from passive and active sensors. Recent moderate resolution sensors are able to provide near real-time data on fires and provide quantitative data used in fire behavior models. Limitations currently exist due to atmospheric interference, pixel resolution, and revisit times. However, a number of new microsatellites and constellations of satellites will be launched in the next five years that contain increased resolution (0.5 m to 1 m pixel resolution for active sensors) and revisit times (daily {$<$} 2.5 m resolution images from passive sensors) that will significantly improve our ability to assess and predict natural hazards from space.},

To minimize the consequences of these catastrophic events, fire managers and national authorities are in need of accurate information regarding the geographic extent of the affected areas, both during the outbreak and shortly after the suppression of the fire event. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether analysis of Earth Observation (EO) data acquired through the International Charter `Space and Major Disasters' can be successfully used to address the requirements of environmental disaster management. Specifically, operational information extracted through reliable and robust object-based classification models was provided on the extent of the total burned area and the environmental implications in the Peloponnese (southern Greece) following a request from the National Forest Service and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Hellas. The results not only revealed the size of the disaster but also indicated the potential operational use of remote sensing in order to provide immediate and precise information to local, national and international organizations in relation to the post-fire impact assessment.},

Jacobs sees this being utterly at odds with urban realities, and leading to the destruction of the city as a living community. This futurist vision insisted on the absolute segregation of the city's different activities into separate zones, linked (though also physically isolated) by super-highways set in wide parkland landscaping. The colossal physical destruction that was necessary to implement this vision tore apart the traditional multi-activity street and densely populated neighborhood that Jacobs avers is the bedrock of urban living},

Its core role is to establish a quantitative relationship between the electromagnetic spectrum and the information obtained by the sensor and then use electromagnetic wave information to quantitatively detect all kinds of surface characteristic parameters. Quantitative remote sensing is based on the precise calibration of sensors and the atmospheric correction of remote sensing data. This chapter introduces the atmospheric effects on the process of remote sensing imaging and atmospheric correction to specifically discuss the utilization of atmospheric correction in processing remote sensing data. Section 1 presents the background of atmospheric effects. Section 2 discusses various algorithms for the estimation of aerosol properties, which are based on spectral, temporal, angular, spatial and polarization characteristics. Section 3 introduces the algorithms used for estimating atmospheric moisture content. Then, the influences of other atmospheric components and commonly used atmospheric correction models are illustrated. Finally, an application of atmospheric correction is presented.},

  abstract = {Intense storm surge can lead to severe coastal floods. Flood inundation simulation is useful to identify areas that are most vulnerable to severe storm surges and to address potential flooding hazards. In this paper, both 2D and 3D hydrodynamic models are built separately to quantify the flood danger to a coastal city. A digital city model is generated by integrating building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) technology based on digital aerial photogrammetry for the 3D hydrodynamic model. The results reveal that 2D hydrodynamic assumptions and approximations weaken if the vertical fluctuations are enormous, especially in urban environments. In comparison, a 3D model coupled with high-resolution topographic data can provide a more realistic and accurate result for the complex flow field. Furthermore, a comparison between using the digital city model and a standard digital elevation model (DEM) in a 3D model has been conducted. The flood inundation is simulated step-wise using the standard DEM, while the wave front propagates in a more realistic manner based on high-resolution topography data. Thus, a 3D hydrodynamic model coupled with the digital city model is recommended for urban flood simulation, which is promising to improve the ability of flood prediction and prevention.},
