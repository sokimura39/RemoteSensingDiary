  abstract = {Rapid increase in population and growing concentration of capital in urban areas has escalated both the severity and longer-term impact of natural disasters. As a result, Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and reduction have been gaining increasing importance for urban areas. Remote sensing plays a key role in providing information for urban DRM analysis due to its agile data acquisition, synoptic perspective, growing range of data types, and instrument sophistication, as well as low cost. As a consequence numerous methods have been developed to extract information for various phases of DRM analysis. However, given the diverse information needs, only few of the parameters of interest are extracted directly, while the majority have to be elicited indirectly using proxies. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the proxies developed for two risk elements typically associated with pre-disaster situations (vulnerability and resilience), and two post-disaster elements (damage and recovery), while focusing on urban DRM. The proxies were reviewed in the context of four main environments and their corresponding sub-categories: built-up (buildings, transport, and others), economic (macro, regional and urban economics, and logistics), social (services and infrastructures, and socio-economic status), and natural. All environments and the corresponding proxies are discussed and analyzed in terms of their reliability and sufficiency in comprehensively addressing the selected DRM assessments. We highlight strength and identify gaps and limitations in current proxies, including inconsistencies in terminology for indirect measurements. We present a systematic overview for each group of the reviewed proxies that could simplify cross-fertilization across different DRM domains and may assist the further development of methods. While systemizing examples from the wider remote sensing domain and insights from social and economic sciences, we suggest a direction for developing new proxies, also potentially suitable for capturing functional recovery.},

These satellites are able to quantify physical geographic phenomena associated with the movements of the earth's surface (earthquakes, mass movements), water (floods, tsunamis, storms), and fire (wildfires). Most of these satellites contain active or passive sensors that can be utilized by the scientific community for the remote sensing of natural hazards over a number of spatial and temporal scales. The most useful satellite imagery for the assessment of earthquake damage comes from high-resolution (0.6 m to 1 m pixel size) passive sensors and moderate resolution active sensors that can quantify the vertical and horizontal movement of the earth's surface. High-resolution passive sensors have been used successfully to assess flood damage while predictive maps of flood vulnerability areas are possible based on physical variables collected from passive and active sensors. Recent moderate resolution sensors are able to provide near real-time data on fires and provide quantitative data used in fire behavior models. Limitations currently exist due to atmospheric interference, pixel resolution, and revisit times. However, a number of new microsatellites and constellations of satellites will be launched in the next five years that contain increased resolution (0.5 m to 1 m pixel resolution for active sensors) and revisit times (daily {$<$} 2.5 m resolution images from passive sensors) that will significantly improve our ability to assess and predict natural hazards from space.},

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether analysis of Earth Observation (EO) data acquired through the International Charter `Space and Major Disasters' can be successfully used to address the requirements of environmental disaster management. Specifically, operational information extracted through reliable and robust object-based classification models was provided on the extent of the total burned area and the environmental implications in the Peloponnese (southern Greece) following a request from the National Forest Service and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Hellas. The results not only revealed the size of the disaster but also indicated the potential operational use of remote sensing in order to provide immediate and precise information to local, national and international organizations in relation to the post-fire impact assessment.},

Objective measure of greenness using remote sensing images is percentage area of green, i.e., Green Index (GI), which is insensitive to spatial arrangement within the areal units. Measuring UGS at neighborhood level is important as neighborhood is the working level for application of greening strategies. Neighborhood (NH) is synonymous of nearness and can be defined as an area of homogeneous characteristics. The Urban Neighborhood Green Index (UNGI) aims to assess the greenness and can help in identifying the critical areas, which in turn can be used to identify action areas for improving the quality of green. For the development of UNGI, four parameters, i.e., GI, proximity to green, built up density and height of structures were used and weighted using Saaty's pair wise comparison method. Four different types of NH were compared and it was found that mean GI (0.44) is equal for high-rise low density and low-rise low density NH, i.e., both areas have same quality of urban green based on GI. But mean UNGI is higher for low-rise low-density NH (0.62), as compared to high-rise low-density NH (0.54), hence, area of highrise NH requires more amounts of good quality properly distributed green as compared to low-rise NH. The input for UNGI is easily derivable from RS images, besides the developed method is simple, and easily comprehendible by city administrators and planners.},

Remote sensing provides spatially explicit information for the mapping process, but its real-time imagery is often not available due to bad weather conditions during the event. Using the 2015 South Carolina Flood in downtown Columbia as a case study, this article proposes a novel approach to retrieve near real-time flood probability map by integrating the post-event remote sensing data with the real-time volunteered geographic information (VGI). Relying on each VGI point, an inverse distance weighted height filter was introduced to build a probability index distribution (PID) layer from the high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data. For each PID layer, a Gaussian kernel was developed to extract its moisture weight from the normalized difference water index (NDWI) of an EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) image. Finally, a normalized flood probability map was produced by chaining the moisture weighted PIDs in a Python environment. Results indicate that, by adding the wetness information from post-event satellite observations, the proposed model could provide near real-time flood probability distribution with real-time social media, which is of great importance for emergency responders to quickly identify areas in need of immediate attention.},

Several methods reported in the literature characterize the spatial distribution of gray levels across an image segment as texture measures. These texture measures represent all the pixels within an image segment as samples from the same population. Another approach to texture analysis is the construction of texture transforms consisting of discrete measures for each pixel. This technique describes the gray-level distributions around each pixel. This paper reports the analysis of texture transforms of multispectral digital imagery. The transforms were derived from local properties computed within three-by-three pixel windows surrounding each pixel. The local properties were computed using a combination of available channels. The properties included: the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of gray levels; mean and maximum gray-level differences; and mean and maximum Euclidean distances between gray level vectors. Logarithmic transformations of the local properties were used to expand the contrast of the texture transforms. Texture transforms of Landsat-2 MSS data were generated. The transforms were useful for edge detection and image enhancement, but did not prove useful as features for the thematic mapping of land cover. These results are compared to a previous investigation for which texture transforms of digitized aerial photography were effectively employed as features for the thematic mapping of terrain categories.},

The performed tests included an assessment of the classification accuracy performed based on spectro-textural datasets: spectral images with the addition of images generated using different texture analysis methods. The class nomenclature was based on spectral and textural differences and included the following classes: water, low vegetation, bare soil, urban, and two (coniferous and deciduous) forest classes. The classification accuracy was assessed using the overall accuracy and kappa index of agreement, based on the reference data generated using visual interpretation of the images. The analysis was performed using very high-resolution imagery (Pleiades, WorldView-2) and high-resolution imagery (Sentinel-2). The results show the efficacy of selected GLCM features and granulometric analysis as tools for providing textural data, which could be used in the process of land use/cover classification. It is also clear that texture analysis is generally a more important and effective component of classification for images of higher resolution. In addition, for classification using GLCM results, the Random Forest variable importance analysis was performed.},

However, it requires robust classification methods that allow accurate mapping of complex land cover categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine-learning classifier that can be used in land remote sensing. However, two important parameters of RF classification, namely, the number of trees and the number of variables tried at each split, affect classification accuracy. Thus, optimal parameter selection is an inevitable problem in RF-based image classification. This study uses the genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the two parameters of RF to produce optimal land cover classification accuracy. HJ-1B CCD2 image data are used to classify six different land cover categories in Changping, Beijing, China. Experimental results show that GA-RF can avoid arbitrariness in the selection of parameters. The experiments also compare land cover classification results by using GA-RF method, traditional RF method (with default parameters), and support vector machine method. When the GA-RF method is used, classification accuracies, respectively, improved by 1.02\% and 6.64\%. The comparison results show that GA-RF is a feasible solution for land cover classification without compromising accuracy or incurring excessive time.},

Flood inundation simulation is useful to identify areas that are most vulnerable to severe storm surges and to address potential flooding hazards. In this paper, both 2D and 3D hydrodynamic models are built separately to quantify the flood danger to a coastal city. A digital city model is generated by integrating building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) technology based on digital aerial photogrammetry for the 3D hydrodynamic model. The results reveal that 2D hydrodynamic assumptions and approximations weaken if the vertical fluctuations are enormous, especially in urban environments. In comparison, a 3D model coupled with high-resolution topographic data can provide a more realistic and accurate result for the complex flow field. Furthermore, a comparison between using the digital city model and a standard digital elevation model (DEM) in a 3D model has been conducted. The flood inundation is simulated step-wise using the standard DEM, while the wave front propagates in a more realistic manner based on high-resolution topography data. Thus, a 3D hydrodynamic model coupled with the digital city model is recommended for urban flood simulation, which is promising to improve the ability of flood prediction and prevention.},

  abstract = {Urbanization is one of the most impactful human activities across the world today affecting the quality of urban life and its sustainable development. Urbanization in Africa is occurring at an unprecedented rate and it threatens the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Urban sprawl has resulted in unsustainable urban development patterns from social, environmental, and economic perspectives. This study is among the first examples of research in Africa to combine remote sensing data with social media data to determine urban sprawl from 2011 to 2017 in Morogoro urban municipality, Tanzania. Random Forest (RF) method was applied to accomplish imagery classification and location-based social media (Twitter usage) data were obtained through a Twitter Application Programming Interface (API). Morogoro urban municipality was classified into built-up, vegetation, agriculture, and water land cover classes while the classification results were validated by the generation of 480 random points. Using the Kernel function, the study measured the location of Twitter users within a 1 km buffer from the center of the city. The results indicate that, expansion of the city (built-up land use), which is primarily driven by population expansion, has negative impacts on ecosystem services because pristine grasslands and forests which provide essential ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and support for biodiversity have been replaced by built-up land cover. In addition, social media usage data suggest that there is the concentration of Twitter usage within the city center while Twitter usage declines away from the city center with significant spatial and numerical increase in Twitter usage in the study area. The outcome of the study suggests that the combination of remote sensing, social sensing, and population data were useful as a proxy/inference for interpreting urban sprawl and status of access to urban services and infrastructure in Morogoro, and Africa city where data for urban planning is often unavailable, inaccurate, or stale.},

  abstract = {Image segmentation can be performed on raw radiometric data, but also on transformed colour spaces, or, for high-resolution images, on textural features. We review several existing colour space transformations and textural features, and investigate which combination of inputs gives best results for the task of segmenting high-resolution multispectral aerial images of rural areas into its constituent cartographic objects such as fields, orchards, forests, or lakes, with a hierarchical segmentation algorithm. A method to quantitatively evaluate the quality of a hierarchical image segmentation is presented, and the behaviour of the segmentation algorithm for various parameter sets is also explored.},
