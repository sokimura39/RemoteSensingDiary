  abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) systems have been collecting massive volumes of datasets for decades, managing and analyzing of which are not practical using common software packages and desktop computing resources. In this regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called Google Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data analysis. In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing data and methods are widely deployed in order to contribute to the assessment of numerous components of earthquake risk. While for earthquake hazard-related investigations, the use of remotely sensed data is an established methodological element with a long research tradition, earthquake vulnerability--centred assessments incorporating remote sensing data are increasing primarily in recent years. This goes along with a changing perspective of the scientific community which considers the assessment of vulnerability and its constituent elements as a pivotal part of a comprehensive risk analysis. Thereby, the availability of new sensors systems enables an appreciable share of remote sensing first. In this manner, a survey of the interdisciplinary conceptual literature dealing with the scientific perception of risk, hazard and vulnerability reveals the demand for a comprehensive description of earthquake hazards as well as an assessment of the present and future conditions of the elements exposed. A review of earthquake-related remote sensing literature, realized both in a qualitative and quantitative manner, shows the already existing and published manifold capabilities of remote sensing contributing to assess earthquake risk. These include earthquake hazard-related analysis such as detection and measurement of lineaments and surface deformations in pre- and post-event applications. Furthermore, pre-event seismic vulnerability--centred assessment of the built and natural environment and damage assessments for post-event applications are presented. Based on the review and the discussion of scientific trends and current research projects, first steps towards a roadmap for remote sensing are drawn, explicitly taking scientific, technical, multi- and transdisciplinary as well as political perspectives into account, which is intended to open possible future research activities.},

  abstract = {Rapid increase in population and growing concentration of capital in urban areas has escalated both the severity and longer-term impact of natural disasters. As a result, Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and reduction have been gaining increasing importance for urban areas. Remote sensing plays a key role in providing information for urban DRM analysis due to its agile data acquisition, synoptic perspective, growing range of data types, and instrument sophistication, as well as low cost. As a consequence numerous methods have been developed to extract information for various phases of DRM analysis. However, given the diverse information needs, only few of the parameters of interest are extracted directly, while the majority have to be elicited indirectly using proxies. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the proxies developed for two risk elements typically associated with pre-disaster situations (vulnerability and resilience), and two post-disaster elements (damage and recovery), while focusing on urban DRM. The proxies were reviewed in the context of four main environments and their corresponding sub-categories: built-up (buildings, transport, and others), economic (macro, regional and urban economics, and logistics), social (services and infrastructures, and socio-economic status), and natural. All environments and the corresponding proxies are discussed and analyzed in terms of their reliability and sufficiency in comprehensively addressing the selected DRM assessments. We highlight strength and identify gaps and limitations in current proxies, including inconsistencies in terminology for indirect measurements. We present a systematic overview for each group of the reviewed proxies that could simplify cross-fertilization across different DRM domains and may assist the further development of methods. While systemizing examples from the wider remote sensing domain and insights from social and economic sciences, we suggest a direction for developing new proxies, also potentially suitable for capturing functional recovery.},

These satellites are able to quantify physical geographic phenomena associated with the movements of the earth's surface (earthquakes, mass movements), water (floods, tsunamis, storms), and fire (wildfires). Most of these satellites contain active or passive sensors that can be utilized by the scientific community for the remote sensing of natural hazards over a number of spatial and temporal scales. The most useful satellite imagery for the assessment of earthquake damage comes from high-resolution (0.6 m to 1 m pixel size) passive sensors and moderate resolution active sensors that can quantify the vertical and horizontal movement of the earth's surface. High-resolution passive sensors have been used successfully to assess flood damage while predictive maps of flood vulnerability areas are possible based on physical variables collected from passive and active sensors. Recent moderate resolution sensors are able to provide near real-time data on fires and provide quantitative data used in fire behavior models. Limitations currently exist due to atmospheric interference, pixel resolution, and revisit times. However, a number of new microsatellites and constellations of satellites will be launched in the next five years that contain increased resolution (0.5 m to 1 m pixel resolution for active sensors) and revisit times (daily {$<$} 2.5 m resolution images from passive sensors) that will significantly improve our ability to assess and predict natural hazards from space.},

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether analysis of Earth Observation (EO) data acquired through the International Charter `Space and Major Disasters' can be successfully used to address the requirements of environmental disaster management. Specifically, operational information extracted through reliable and robust object-based classification models was provided on the extent of the total burned area and the environmental implications in the Peloponnese (southern Greece) following a request from the National Forest Service and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Hellas. The results not only revealed the size of the disaster but also indicated the potential operational use of remote sensing in order to provide immediate and precise information to local, national and international organizations in relation to the post-fire impact assessment.},

Objective measure of greenness using remote sensing images is percentage area of green, i.e., Green Index (GI), which is insensitive to spatial arrangement within the areal units. Measuring UGS at neighborhood level is important as neighborhood is the working level for application of greening strategies. Neighborhood (NH) is synonymous of nearness and can be defined as an area of homogeneous characteristics. The Urban Neighborhood Green Index (UNGI) aims to assess the greenness and can help in identifying the critical areas, which in turn can be used to identify action areas for improving the quality of green. For the development of UNGI, four parameters, i.e., GI, proximity to green, built up density and height of structures were used and weighted using Saaty's pair wise comparison method. Four different types of NH were compared and it was found that mean GI (0.44) is equal for high-rise low density and low-rise low density NH, i.e., both areas have same quality of urban green based on GI. But mean UNGI is higher for low-rise low-density NH (0.62), as compared to high-rise low-density NH (0.54), hence, area of highrise NH requires more amounts of good quality properly distributed green as compared to low-rise NH. The input for UNGI is easily derivable from RS images, besides the developed method is simple, and easily comprehendible by city administrators and planners.},

Remote sensing provides spatially explicit information for the mapping process, but its real-time imagery is often not available due to bad weather conditions during the event. Using the 2015 South Carolina Flood in downtown Columbia as a case study, this article proposes a novel approach to retrieve near real-time flood probability map by integrating the post-event remote sensing data with the real-time volunteered geographic information (VGI). Relying on each VGI point, an inverse distance weighted height filter was introduced to build a probability index distribution (PID) layer from the high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data. For each PID layer, a Gaussian kernel was developed to extract its moisture weight from the normalized difference water index (NDWI) of an EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) image. Finally, a normalized flood probability map was produced by chaining the moisture weighted PIDs in a Python environment. Results indicate that, by adding the wetness information from post-event satellite observations, the proposed model could provide near real-time flood probability distribution with real-time social media, which is of great importance for emergency responders to quickly identify areas in need of immediate attention.},

Several methods reported in the literature characterize the spatial distribution of gray levels across an image segment as texture measures. These texture measures represent all the pixels within an image segment as samples from the same population. Another approach to texture analysis is the construction of texture transforms consisting of discrete measures for each pixel. This technique describes the gray-level distributions around each pixel. This paper reports the analysis of texture transforms of multispectral digital imagery. The transforms were derived from local properties computed within three-by-three pixel windows surrounding each pixel. The local properties were computed using a combination of available channels. The properties included: the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of gray levels; mean and maximum gray-level differences; and mean and maximum Euclidean distances between gray level vectors. Logarithmic transformations of the local properties were used to expand the contrast of the texture transforms. Texture transforms of Landsat-2 MSS data were generated. The transforms were useful for edge detection and image enhancement, but did not prove useful as features for the thematic mapping of land cover. These results are compared to a previous investigation for which texture transforms of digitized aerial photography were effectively employed as features for the thematic mapping of terrain categories.},

The performed tests included an assessment of the classification accuracy performed based on spectro-textural datasets: spectral images with the addition of images generated using different texture analysis methods. The class nomenclature was based on spectral and textural differences and included the following classes: water, low vegetation, bare soil, urban, and two (coniferous and deciduous) forest classes. The classification accuracy was assessed using the overall accuracy and kappa index of agreement, based on the reference data generated using visual interpretation of the images. The analysis was performed using very high-resolution imagery (Pleiades, WorldView-2) and high-resolution imagery (Sentinel-2). The results show the efficacy of selected GLCM features and granulometric analysis as tools for providing textural data, which could be used in the process of land use/cover classification. It is also clear that texture analysis is generally a more important and effective component of classification for images of higher resolution. In addition, for classification using GLCM results, the Random Forest variable importance analysis was performed.},

However, it requires robust classification methods that allow accurate mapping of complex land cover categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine-learning classifier that can be used in land remote sensing. However, two important parameters of RF classification, namely, the number of trees and the number of variables tried at each split, affect classification accuracy. Thus, optimal parameter selection is an inevitable problem in RF-based image classification. This study uses the genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the two parameters of RF to produce optimal land cover classification accuracy. HJ-1B CCD2 image data are used to classify six different land cover categories in Changping, Beijing, China. Experimental results show that GA-RF can avoid arbitrariness in the selection of parameters. The experiments also compare land cover classification results by using GA-RF method, traditional RF method (with default parameters), and support vector machine method. When the GA-RF method is used, classification accuracies, respectively, improved by 1.02\% and 6.64\%. The comparison results show that GA-RF is a feasible solution for land cover classification without compromising accuracy or incurring excessive time.},

  abstract = {Intense storm surge can lead to severe coastal floods. Flood inundation simulation is useful to identify areas that are most vulnerable to severe storm surges and to address potential flooding hazards. In this paper, both 2D and 3D hydrodynamic models are built separately to quantify the flood danger to a coastal city. A digital city model is generated by integrating building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) technology based on digital aerial photogrammetry for the 3D hydrodynamic model. The results reveal that 2D hydrodynamic assumptions and approximations weaken if the vertical fluctuations are enormous, especially in urban environments. In comparison, a 3D model coupled with high-resolution topographic data can provide a more realistic and accurate result for the complex flow field. Furthermore, a comparison between using the digital city model and a standard digital elevation model (DEM) in a 3D model has been conducted. The flood inundation is simulated step-wise using the standard DEM, while the wave front propagates in a more realistic manner based on high-resolution topography data. Thus, a 3D hydrodynamic model coupled with the digital city model is recommended for urban flood simulation, which is promising to improve the ability of flood prediction and prevention.},

  abstract = {Urbanization is one of the most impactful human activities across the world today affecting the quality of urban life and its sustainable development. Urbanization in Africa is occurring at an unprecedented rate and it threatens the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Urban sprawl has resulted in unsustainable urban development patterns from social, environmental, and economic perspectives. This study is among the first examples of research in Africa to combine remote sensing data with social media data to determine urban sprawl from 2011 to 2017 in Morogoro urban municipality, Tanzania. Random Forest (RF) method was applied to accomplish imagery classification and location-based social media (Twitter usage) data were obtained through a Twitter Application Programming Interface (API). Morogoro urban municipality was classified into built-up, vegetation, agriculture, and water land cover classes while the classification results were validated by the generation of 480 random points. Using the Kernel function, the study measured the location of Twitter users within a 1 km buffer from the center of the city. The results indicate that, expansion of the city (built-up land use), which is primarily driven by population expansion, has negative impacts on ecosystem services because pristine grasslands and forests which provide essential ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and support for biodiversity have been replaced by built-up land cover. In addition, social media usage data suggest that there is the concentration of Twitter usage within the city center while Twitter usage declines away from the city center with significant spatial and numerical increase in Twitter usage in the study area. The outcome of the study suggests that the combination of remote sensing, social sensing, and population data were useful as a proxy/inference for interpreting urban sprawl and status of access to urban services and infrastructure in Morogoro, and Africa city where data for urban planning is often unavailable, inaccurate, or stale.},

We assess its capacity to conduct space--time analysis over two subregions of Singapore, namely, Tuas and the Central Catchment Reserve (CCR), for Urban and Wetlands land classes. In its current state, GEE has proven to be a powerful tool by providing access to a wide variety of imagery in one consolidated system. Furthermore, it possesses the ability to perform spatial aggregations over global-scale data at a high computational speed though; supporting both spatial and temporal analysis is not an obvious task for the platform. We examine the challenges that GEE faces, also common to most parallel-processing, big-data architectures. The ongoing refinement of this system makes it promising for big-data analysts from diverse user groups. As a use case for exploring GEE, we analyze Singapore's land use and cover. We observe the change in Singapore's landmass through land reclamation. Also, within the region of the CCR, a large protected area, we find forest cover is not affected by anthropogenic factors, but instead is driven by the monsoon cycles affecting Southeast Asia.},

  abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based geospatial processing platform for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. The free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine learning algorithms using Google's computational infrastructure; and (3) a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the ``big picture'' of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90\% of studies while 10\% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40~years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27\% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.},

  abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is providing a systematic, synoptic framework for advancing scientific knowledge of the Earth as a complex system of geophysical phenomena that, directly and through interacting processes, often lead to natural hazards. Improved and integrated measurements along with numerical modeling are enabling a greater understanding of where and when a particular hazard event is most likely to occur and result in significant socioeconomic impact. Geospatial information products derived from this research increasingly are addressing the operational requirements of decision support systems used by policy makers, emergency managers and responders from international and federal to regional, state and local jurisdictions. This forms the basis for comprehensive risk assessments and better-informed mitigation planning, disaster assessment and response prioritization. Space-based geodetic measurements of the solid Earth with the Global Positioning System, for example, combined with ground-based seismological measurements, are yielding the principal data for modeling lithospheric processes and for accurately estimating the distribution of potentially damaging strong ground motions which is critical for earthquake engineering applications. Moreover, integrated with interferometric synthetic aperture radar, these measurements provide spatially continuous observations of deformation with sub-centimeter accuracy. Seismic and in situ monitoring, geodetic measurements, high-resolution digital elevation models (e.g. from InSAR, Lidar and digital photogrammetry) and imaging spectroscopy (e.g. using ASTER, MODIS and Hyperion) are contributing significantly to volcanic hazard risk assessment, with the potential to aid land use planning in developing countries where the impact of volcanic hazards to populations and lifelines is continually increasing. Remotely sensed data play an integral role in reconstructing the recent history of the land surface and in predicting hazards due to flood and landslide events. Satellite data are addressing diverse observational requirements that are imposed by the need for surface, subsurface and hydrologic characterization, including the delineation of flood and landslide zones for risk assessments. Short- and long-term sea-level change and the impact of ocean-atmosphere processes on the coastal land environment, through flooding, erosion and storm surge for example, define further requirements for hazard monitoring and mitigation planning. The continued development and application of a broad spectrum of satellite remote sensing systems and attendant data management infrastructure will contribute needed baseline and time series data, as part of an integrated global observation strategy that includes airborne and in situ measurements of the solid Earth. Multi-hazard modeling capabilities, in turn, will result in more accurate forecasting and visualizations for improving the decision support tools and systems used by the international disaster management community.},
