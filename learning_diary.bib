  abstract = {Since 2000, there have been a number of spaceborne satellites that have changed the way we assess and predict natural hazards. These satellites are able to quantify physical geographic phenomena associated with the movements of the earth's surface (earthquakes, mass movements), water (floods, tsunamis, storms), and fire (wildfires). Most of these satellites contain active or passive sensors that can be utilized by the scientific community for the remote sensing of natural hazards over a number of spatial and temporal scales. The most useful satellite imagery for the assessment of earthquake damage comes from high-resolution (0.6 m to 1 m pixel size) passive sensors and moderate resolution active sensors that can quantify the vertical and horizontal movement of the earth's surface. High-resolution passive sensors have been used successfully to assess flood damage while predictive maps of flood vulnerability areas are possible based on physical variables collected from passive and active sensors. Recent moderate resolution sensors are able to provide near real-time data on fires and provide quantitative data used in fire behavior models. Limitations currently exist due to atmospheric interference, pixel resolution, and revisit times. However, a number of new microsatellites and constellations of satellites will be launched in the next five years that contain increased resolution (0.5 m to 1 m pixel resolution for active sensors) and revisit times (daily {$<$} 2.5 m resolution images from passive sensors) that will significantly improve our ability to assess and predict natural hazards from space.},

  abstract = {Quantitative remote sensing is an inevitable trend in the application of remote sensing in the 21st century. Its core role is to establish a quantitative relationship between the electromagnetic spectrum and the information obtained by the sensor and then use electromagnetic wave information to quantitatively detect all kinds of surface characteristic parameters. Quantitative remote sensing is based on the precise calibration of sensors and the atmospheric correction of remote sensing data. This chapter introduces the atmospheric effects on the process of remote sensing imaging and atmospheric correction to specifically discuss the utilization of atmospheric correction in processing remote sensing data. Section 1 presents the background of atmospheric effects. Section 2 discusses various algorithms for the estimation of aerosol properties, which are based on spectral, temporal, angular, spatial and polarization characteristics. Section 3 introduces the algorithms used for estimating atmospheric moisture content. Then, the influences of other atmospheric components and commonly used atmospheric correction models are illustrated. Finally, an application of atmospheric correction is presented.},
