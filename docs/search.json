    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote Sensing: acquiring information from a distance (NASA 2019). There is a huge number of satellites carrying sensors that observe the earth.\n\n1.1.1 Characteristics of Satellite Imagery\nThe data that can be acquired from remote sensing is interesting! Few things that caught my attention:\n\nThe availability of data is amazing. The whole globe is covered every day, including areas impossible to be accessed by humans.\nUsing different wavelengths let us see what the human eye cannot. For instance, near infrared lets us differentiate vegetation from other “green stuff”.\n\n\n\n\nA false color image of NYC and the Hudson Valley using NIR bands, where vegetation appears red\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Interaction with atmosphere\nThe atmosphere impacts the satellite image, which we must account for. There are a few “windows” that electromagnetic waves with certain wavelengths can pass through: the most notable one being the optical window, and the radio window. We must also consider the scattering for the wavelengths that do pass by. We have to consider these interactions with atmosphere when we use data, but nowadays software does the hard work for us.\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Windows from GISGeography (2017)\n\n\nMeanwhile the astronomers have put their telescope in outer space to avoid the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope in outer space\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Resolutions of Satellite Imagery\nResolutions for satellite imagery has different dimensions of resolutions, something I did not think about before.\n\nSpatial Resolution: the size of each pixel within the image. Higher resolution means you can see the surface of the earth with more detail. This was the only type that came into my mind before this lecture.\nSpectral Resolution: the number of bands of different wavelengths an observation has. This includes visible light such as red, green, and blue, but spans into wavelengths undetectable by the human eye. Some hyperspectral images have more than 200! The better spectral resolution, the better it is to differentiate the materials.\nRadiometric Resolution: is the amount of information in each pixel, the higher the value the more potential values it has. Distinguishing slight changes are made possible with high radiometric resolution. I feel this is a similar idea to the color depth, where 24-bit colors have more variety than 8-bit colors.\nTemporal Resolution: the frequency the data is collected, or the frequency the satellite flies over each area. SENTINEL-2 has 2 satellites, doubling the temporal resolutions compared to having only one.\n\nThese often come with trade-offs (detailed data comes at the cost of lower frequency) therefore we must be aware which is important for analysis that we make."

    "section": "3.1 Summary",
    "text": "3.1 Summary\nIn order to use the remote sensing data most effectively, data manipulation is desired. This comes in two perspectives: correcting data to remove the impacts from unnecessary factors, and joining and enhansing data.\n\n3.1.1 Data Correction\nThe raw data fetched from satellites are subject to interference by environmental factors. Data correction is required to correctly analyse the satellite imagery obtained. The following explains the various aspects of data correction.\nThankfully, the contemporary satellite imagery prouducts come in ARD: Analysis Ready Data so I am expecting we don’t need to worry too much about these jargons.\n\nAtmospheric Correction\nRemoving the effect of atmosphere which absorbs and scatters light, leading to haze (reduced contrast of image) and the adjacency effect (nearby pixels bleeding into each other).\n\nRelative Correction\nRelative correction normalises intensities of bands within a single iamge or within multiple dates. The dark object subtraction (DOS) method assumes the darkest value in the image displays the effect of atmosphere, and subtracts that value from the whole image, leaving the actual surface reflectance value. Other methods such as pseudo-invariant features are proposed as well.\nWhile these simple methods can calibrate values within one imagery, the relative nature does not allow for comparison between different imagery - this is where absolute correction comes into play.\n\n\nAbsolute Correction\nCalculates the scaled absolute value for surface reflectance, enabling comparison between different places on earth. Multiple models are proposed, or a field work can be conducted to make the satellite observe the empirical line of spectrometer you laid out in the wild.\n\n\n\nExample of atmospheric correction. Image from Liang and Wang (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric Correction\nGeometric correction is manipulation to fit the earth observation data into a reference system. This is similar to the process of georeferencing analog maps (Skopyk 2021).\nThis is achieved by taking several reference points (Ground Control Points) on the imagery where the actual coordinates are known, and interpolating the areas in between (Jensen 2016).\n\n\n\nReference points on satellite imagery and the gold standard map (image from SEOS)\n\n\nThe actual mapping is done backwards, where points on the imagery are calculated from coordinates on the gold standard map, so that every point on the study area has its corresponding point on the imagery. This is modelled as follows.\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx^i = a_0 + a_1x + a_2y+\\epsilon_i \\\\\ny^i = b_0 + b_1x + b_2y+\\epsilon_i \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\\((x^i, y^i)\\): coordinates on the satellite imagery\n\\((x, y)\\): coordinates on the gold standard map\n\nOrthorectification or topographic correction is one aspect of this, correcting the image so that it is viewed at nadir. One method is cosine correction, where the radiance is calculated as:\n\\[\nL_H = L_T \\frac{\\cos \\theta_O}{\\cos i}\n\\]\n\n\\(L_T\\): radiance (TOA) from sloped terrain\n\\(\\theta_O\\): zenith angle of the sun\n\\(i\\): sun’s incidence angle (angle between rays and normal of surface)\n\nThis will be important especially if using imagery from aircrafts flying at relatively low altitude compared to satellites.\n\n\nRadiometric Calibration\nThe original satellite imagery stores data using digital numbers (DN) which has no units! This needs to be translated into values with meaningful units.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data Joining and Enhancement\nWe do not need to use the data as is, but are open to wrangling data for analysis as well.\n\n\n3.1.3 Glossary\nThere were a lot of new terminology introduced in this session.\n\n3.1.3.1 Data Correction Vocabulary\n\nnadir: looking straight down, not at an angle.\nzenith: point vertically above observer. Zenith Angle is the angle between object and zenith.\nincident angle: the angle between the normal of the sloped terrain and the sun. If horizontal, this matches the zenith angle.\nazimuth: the compass angle of the sun, measured from the north. Same idea with runway names!\n\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Data Enhancement Vocabulary\n\nTexture:\nPCA:"

Long-term observations may be used to measure the change in temperature, precipitation, and so forth.\nSocio-economic features through earth observation\nSince there is so much focus on the apparently unphysical characteristics of the urban landscape, I feel I should ask the question: is there a way to address socio-economic issues using infrastructure?\nWe must recall New York is the site of the world-famous dispute between the great activist Jane Jacobs and the master builder Robert Moses (Paletta 2016), which sparked off from the plans for the Lower Manhattan Expressway which was to destroy the local environment. Some potential strategies may be: 1) how much amenity space demolished? (There should have been victims even after Washington Square Park was saved), and 2) are infrastructure casting negative impacts on the livability of the city (like, shadows cast on neighbourhoods?)\nWe will explore methodology in the application section.\n\n\n4.1.2 G7 Sustainable Urban Development Ministers’ Meeting Communique\nNow I will look at an international agreement with focus on cities.\nThe outcome document for the G7 Sustainable Urban Development Ministers’ Meeting in Takamatsu, Kagawa, the second G7 ministerial meeting by ministers in charge of urban policies, held during the Japanese presidency of G7 in 2023.\nA niche policy document, yes. I specifically chose this one because:\n\nit’s very recent (July 2023)\nit is drawing from other international agendas\nI was involved in the editing process just before starting my master’s course\n\nThis addresses the issues we have in contemporary cities (in the G7 context), and I would want to see if anything can be related to remote sensing in general.\nThis document addresses 3 overarching themes, having a total of 54 paragraphs:\n\nNet-zero and resilient cities\nInclusive cities\nDigitalisation in cities\n\nThe few topics I thought remote sensing has a part to play:\nParagraph 15 - Biodiversity in cities:\n\n… Green and blue space in cities is too often at risk of being lost due to urban development that is not biodiversity-inclusive; built areas are expanding faster than the population is growing, and unplanned, uncoordinated urban development around cities is consuming the natural environment and green and blue space. …\n\nThis statement implies the problem lies in:\n\nthe expansion of built-up areas faster than population growth\nurban sprawl destroying green and blue spaces\n\nand that these phenomena lead to a loss in biodiversity.\nParagraph 18 - Integration of land use policy and transport policy:\n\nIntegrating land use policies with transport policies is a good example of policy coordination.\n\nThis comes down to building up areas that are accessible by public transport, the idea of compact plus network the Japanese are so keen about.\nThe current situation of urban sprawl and loss of urban green and blue spaces may be observed using EO data. Using the long-term observation data (i.e. Landsat Project) we will be able to observe the growth of built-up areas over time, what type of land (vegetation, water, or else) it has consumed, and if it was a sprawl development or a more controlled one.\nThe digitalisation part has a lot of interesting statements regarding open data, but not much was mentioned regarding EO data."

    "text": "4.2 Applications\nI have identified a few topics that remote sensing may play a role.\n\nResilience against natural hazards\nGrowth of urban built-up areas and impact on green and blue spaces\nLand use and match with transportation\nSocio-economic factors and urban landscape\n\nThe following are potential methodology that may be suitable for the analysis of areas.\n\n4.2.1 Resilience against natural hazards\nGhaffarian, Kerle, and Filatova (2018) has provided a review on proxy parameters for disaster risk that can be extracted from satellite imagery. These include building height and material for vulnerability against earthquakes, road network analysis for assessment of transport networks, and flood water levels and debris detection for flood risk assessment. Rong et al. (2020) has used DSM (Digital Surface Model) data for hydrodynamic simulation of flood risks, a method where Gillespie et al. (2007) has indicated but faced limitations of spatial resolution at that age.\nData on the spatial characteristics of cities can be a useful way to assess flood and other disaster risk.\n\n\n4.2.2 Built-up areas and green and blue spaces\nLand cover mapping is one of the major applications of earth observation data (Ming et al. 2016), and a lot of work has been done to achieve this.\nMing et al. (2016) has used random forest methods to classify natural land cover using satellite data, where they have classified usages with high averages, but limitations lie in its accuracy to identify urban areas compared to natural land cover.\nGupta et al. (2012) has proposed the Urban Neighborhood Green Index - an index of quality of green space within built-up areas using NDVI (vegetation detection), building height estimation (shadow length) and classification of vegetation (using image classification techniques).\nThese methodologies can be used for approximating the available green space within the urban landscape, and an index will allow for comparisons between cities.s\n\n\n4.2.3 Land use and infrastructure\nThis is a minor revision of the above: comparing the built-up area with the infrastructure is a potential way to identify the disadvantages of urban sprawl. An interesting approach by Shao et al. (2021) combined the identification of built-up areas using remote sensing and social media activity location data, and suggested the relative inactivity in sprawl areas is related to the lack of telecommunication infrastructure. By comparing the usages of infrastructure (such as transport OD data) and urban built up areas, we may be able to draw some interesting characteristics of urban areas.\n\n\n4.2.4 Socio-economic factors\nEvaluation of socio-economic factors are a difficult topic just by using earth observation data.\nFew suggestions include:\n\nNetwork analysis of transport infrastructure\nNight-time lights data for economic analysis\nBuilding footprints\nReflection levels (high-level of reflection indicate industrial land use)\nBuilding shadows? Shaded by infrastructure?\n\nI might need some extra reading on this, but I feel it will be an interesting topic to explore. Urban morphology and the architecture is heavily dependent on the local environment and culture, so unsure if one way of data observation can contribute to the whole picture."

Even if stakeholders agree on the big picture, the individual statements do not necessarily align their interests, thus leading to dispute. When it comes to technical methodology, I doubt those decision-makers have the capability to debate in the first place.\nNonetheless it is undeniably an important topic, so I believe this is where experts come into play, actually assessing policies based on the rules those policy documents have set up.\nI feel that remote sensing data has the potential to overcome some of the problems; one major cause of dispute among different stakeholders is the varying definitions and interpretations of topics on the international agenda. The nature of satellite imagery where all parts of the globe are sensed equally may contribute to solving common causes of disagreement such as lack of data, different people having different criteria and explanations, the problem of cost, and more.\nThis was a very good exercise for me!\n\n\n\n\nGhaffarian, Saman, Norman Kerle, and Tatiana Filatova. 2018. “Remote Sensing-Based Proxies for Urban Disaster Risk Management and Resilience: A Review.” Remote Sensing 10 (11): 1760. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10111760.\n\n\nGillespie, Thomas W., Jasmine Chu, Elizabeth Frankenberg, and Duncan Thomas. 2007. “Assessment and Prediction of Natural Hazards from Satellite Imagery.” Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment 31 (5): 459–70. https://doi.org/10.1177/0309133307083296.\n\n\nGupta, Kshama, Pramod Kumar, S.
