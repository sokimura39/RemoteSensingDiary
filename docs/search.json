    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote Sensing: acquiring information from a distance (NASA 2019). There is a huge number of satellites carrying sensors that observe the earth.\n\n1.1.1 Characteristics of Satellite Imagery\nThe data that can be acquired from remote sensing is interesting! Few things that caught my attention:\n\nThe availability of data is amazing. The whole globe is covered every day, including areas impossible to be accessed by humans.\nUsing different wavelengths let us see what the human eye cannot. For instance, near infrared lets us differentiate vegetation from other “green stuff”.\n\n\n\n\nA false color image of NYC and the Hudson Valley using NIR bands, where vegetation appears red\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Interaction with atmosphere\nThe atmosphere impacts the satellite image, which we must account for. There are a few “windows” that electromagnetic waves with certain wavelengths can pass through: the most notable one being the optical window, and the radio window. We must also consider the scattering for the wavelengths that do pass by. We have to consider these interactions with atmosphere when we use data, but nowadays software does the hard work for us.\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Windows from GISGeography (2017)\n\n\nMeanwhile the astronomers have put their telescope in outer space to avoid the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope in outer space\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Resolutions of Satellite Imagery\nResolutions for satellite imagery has different dimensions of resolutions, something I did not think about before.\n\nSpatial Resolution: the size of each pixel within the image. Higher resolution means you can see the surface of the earth with more detail. This was the only type that came into my mind before this lecture.\nSpectral Resolution: the number of bands of different wavelengths an observation has. This includes visible light such as red, green, and blue, but spans into wavelengths undetectable by the human eye. Some hyperspectral images have more than 200! The better spectral resolution, the better it is to differentiate the materials.\nRadiometric Resolution: is the amount of information in each pixel, the higher the value the more potential values it has. Distinguishing slight changes are made possible with high radiometric resolution. I feel this is a similar idea to the color depth, where 24-bit colors have more variety than 8-bit colors.\nTemporal Resolution: the frequency the data is collected, or the frequency the satellite flies over each area. SENTINEL-2 has 2 satellites, doubling the temporal resolutions compared to having only one.\n\nThese often come with trade-offs (detailed data comes at the cost of lower frequency) therefore we must be aware which is important for analysis that we make."

Nonetheless, the applications of satellite imagery is very fascinating!\n\n1.3.1 An Additional Note\nRecent news from my home country of Japan, hit by an earthquake and tsunami on New Year’s Day, featured satellite imagery showing the damage by the disaster. Japan is situated within the Pacific Ring of Fire, and is under an emergent threat of a massive earthquake hitting Tokyo and the most of the Pacific region (70% chance within the next 30 years).

    "section": "3.1 Summary",
    "text": "3.1 Summary\nIn order to use the remote sensing data most effectively, data manipulation is desired. This comes in two perspectives: correcting data to remove the impacts from unnecessary factors, and joining and enhansing data.\n\n3.1.1 Data Correction\nThe raw data fetched from satellites are subject to interference by environmental factors. Data correction is required to correctly analyse the satellite imagery obtained. The following explains the various aspects of data correction.\nThankfully, the contemporary satellite imagery prouducts come in ARD: Analysis Ready Data so I am expecting we don’t need to worry too much about these jargons.\n\n3.1.1.1 Atmospheric Correction\nRemoving the effect of atmosphere which absorbs and scatters light, leading to haze (reduced contrast of image) and the adjacency effect (nearby pixels bleeding into each other).\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Geometric Correction\nGeometric correction is manipulation to fit the earth observation data into a reference system. This is similar to the process of georeferencing analog maps (Skopyk 2021).\nThis is achieved by taking several reference points (Ground Control Points) on the imagery where the actual coordinates are known, and interpolating the areas in between (Jensen 2016).\n![Reference points on satellite imagery and the gold standard map (image from SEOS)(https://seos-project.eu/remotesensing/images/georeferenzieren.jpg)\nThe actual mapping is done backwards, where points on the imagery are calculated from coordinates on the gold standard map, so that every point on the study area has its corresponding point on the imagery. This is modelled as follows.\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx^i = a_0 + a_1x + a_2y+\\epsilon_i \\\\\ny^i = b_0 + b_1x + b_2y+\\epsilon_i \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\\((x^i, y^i)\\): coordinates on the satellite imagery\n\\((x, y)\\): coordinates on the gold standard map\n\nOrthorectification or topographic correction is one aspect of this, correcting the image so that it is viewed at nadir. One method is cosine correction, where the radiance is calculated as:\n\\[\nL_H = L_T \\frac{\\cos \\theta_O}{\\cos i}\n\\]\n\n\\(L_T\\): radiance (TOA) from sloped terrain\n\\(\\theta_O\\): zenith angle of the sun\n\\(i\\): sun’s incidence angle (angle between rays and normal of surface)\n\nThis will be important especially if using imagery from aircrafts flying at relatively low altitude compared to satellites.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data Joining and Enhancement\nWe do not need to use the data as is, but are open to wrangling data for analysis as well.\n\n\n3.1.3 Glossary\nThere were a lot of new terminology introduced in this session.\n\n3.1.3.1 Data Correction Vocabulary\n\nnadir: looking straight down, not at an angle.\nzenith: point vertically above observer. Zenith Angle is the angle between object and zenith.\nincident angle: the angle between the normal of the sloped terrain and the sun. If horizontal, this matches the zenith angle.\nazimuth: the compass angle of the sun, measured from the north. Same idea with runway names!\n\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Data Enhancement Vocabulary\n\nTexture:\nPCA:"
