# Remote Sensing Data Manipulation

## Summary

In order to use the remote sensing data most effectively, data manipulation is desired. This comes in two perspectives: correcting data to remove the impacts from unnecessary factors, and joining and enhansing data.

### Data Correction

The *raw* data fetched from satellites are subject to interference by environmental factors. 

#### Atmospheric Correction

#### Geometric Correction

Geometric correction is manipulation to fit the earth observation data into a reference system. 

**Orthorectification** or topographic correction is one aspect of this, correcting the image so that it is viewed at *nadir*.

### Data Joining and Enhancement

We do not need to use the data as is, but are open to wrangling data for analysis as well.


### Glossary

There were a lot of new terminology introduced in this session. 

#### Data Correction Vocabulary

- **nadir**: looking straight down, not at an angle

#### Data Enhancement Vocabulary

- **Texture**: 
- **PCA**:


## Applications



## Reflection

After a few weeks, I am starting to understand what you can actually do with remote sensing data.
