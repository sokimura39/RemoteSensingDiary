# Remote Sensing Data Manipulation

## Summary

In order to use the remote sensing data most effectively, data manipulation is desired. This comes in two perspectives: correcting data to remove the impacts from unnecessary factors, and joining and enhansing data.

### Data Correction

The *raw* data fetched from satellites are subject to interference by environmental factors. Data correction is required to correctly analyse the satellite imagery obtained. The following explains the various aspects of data correction.

Thankfully, the contemporary satellite imagery prouducts come in **ARD: Analysis Ready Data** so I am expecting we don't need to worry too much about these jargons.

#### Atmospheric Correction {.unnumbered}

Removing the effect of atmosphere which absorbs and scatters light, leading to haze (reduced contrast of image) and the adjacency effect (nearby pixels bleeding into each other).

##### Relative Correction {.unnumbered}

Relative correction normalises intensities of bands within a single iamge or within multiple dates. The **dark object subtraction (DOS)** method assumes the darkest value in the image displays the effect of atmosphere, and subtracts that value from the whole image, leaving the actual surface reflectance value. Other methods such as **pseudo-invariant features** are proposed as well.

While these simple methods can calibrate values within one imagery, the *relative* nature does not allow for comparison between different imagery - this is where absolute correction comes into play.

##### Absolute Correction {.unnumbered}

Calculates the scaled absolute value for surface reflectance, enabling comparison between different places on earth. Multiple models are proposed, or a field work can be conducted to make the satellite observe the empirical line of spectrometer you laid out in the wild.

#### Geometric Correction {.unnumbered}

Geometric correction is manipulation to fit the earth observation data into a reference system. This is similar to the process of georeferencing analog maps [@skopyk2021].

This is achieved by taking several reference points (Ground Control Points) on the imagery where the actual coordinates are known, and interpolating the areas in between [@jensen2016].

![Reference points on satellite imagery and the gold standard map (image from SEOS)](https://seos-project.eu/remotesensing/images/georeferenzieren.jpg)

The actual mapping is done *backwards*, where points on the imagery are calculated from coordinates on the gold standard map, so that every point on the study area has its corresponding point on the imagery. This is modelled as follows.

$$
\begin{cases}
x^i = a_0 + a_1x + a_2y+\epsilon_i \\
y^i = b_0 + b_1x + b_2y+\epsilon_i \\
\end{cases}
$$

-   $(x^i, y^i)$: coordinates on the satellite imagery
-   $(x, y)$: coordinates on the gold standard map

**Orthorectification** or topographic correction is one aspect of this, correcting the image so that it is viewed at *nadir*. One method is cosine correction, where the radiance is calculated as:

$$
L_H = L_T \frac{\cos \theta_O}{\cos i}
$$

-   $L_T$: radiance (TOA) from sloped terrain
-   $\theta_O$: zenith angle of the sun
-   $i$: sun's incidence angle (angle between rays and normal of surface)

This will be important especially if using imagery from aircrafts flying at relatively low altitude compared to satellites.

#### Radiometric Calibration {.unnumbered}

The original satellite imagery stores data using **digital numbers (DN)** which has no units! This needs to be translated into values with meaningful units.

### Data Joining and Enhancement

We do not need to use the data as is, but are open to wrangling data for analysis as well.




### Glossary

There were a lot of new terminology introduced in this session.

#### Data Correction Vocabulary

-   **nadir**: looking straight down, not at an angle.
-   **zenith**: point vertically above observer. **Zenith Angle** is the angle between object and zenith.
-   **incident angle**: the angle between the normal of the sloped terrain and the sun. If horizontal, this matches the zenith angle.
-   **azimuth**: the compass angle of the sun, measured from the north. Same idea with [runway names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway#Naming)!

#### Data Enhancement Vocabulary

-   **Texture**:
-   **PCA**:

After a few weeks, I am starting to understand what you can actually do with remote sensing data.
