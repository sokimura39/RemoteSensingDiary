# Getting Started with Remote Sensing


## Summary

Satellites can see what the human eye cannot! One illustrative example is the near-infrared band that is reflected strongly by vegetation. With combination to other bands, you can tell vegetation from the other greens.

The atmosphere impacts the satellite image, with windows that can .

Meanwhile the astronomers have put their telescope in outer space to avoid the atmosphere ([Why a Telescope in Space? - NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/why-a-space-telescope-in-space/))

## Applications

The applications of satellite imagery is huge:

## Reflection

The first impression on the term *remote sensing* was that we are going to do something about sensors located at the surface (which is what I assume the people at the MSc Connected Environments are doing). Nonetheless, the applications of satellite imagery is very fascinating!
